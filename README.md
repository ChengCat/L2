Having spent many unsuccessful hours trying to motivate the programming language, I have resigned to describing what it is like. It is like C when you are compiling it to binary. Its memory management is like C globally, and locally it is like a stack machine with procedure returns automatically popping data off the stack. Its control flow kind of resembles that of Scheme. Its "preprocessor" is a combination Common Lisp's ordinary and reader macros. As arbitrary as this may seem, I do not think the language is arbitrary.
